/* JDK, JRE and JVM working principle
JVM: JVM run the byte code. all the code run into JVM.
JRE: it provides runtime for java applications like packages, libraries
JDK: JDK compile the java code to produce byte code

class and object: 
=> class or object have some properties and behaviors or actions
=> main method is start of execution of a java file.
=> each class in java like a component for application
=> method overloading means same method name with different parameters and their types

Stack and Heap memory in JVM:
=> JVM has the Stack and Heap memory
=> in class, all the variable inside class is called instance variable. but variable inside a method is called local variable.
=> instance variable store into stack of JVM.
=> note: each method has one stack
