/*
.....what is multi threading and how it works

=> CPU can  handle multiple program or multiple applications at a time, that is why we can play music, write code, open browser etc. that is called multi tasking
=> a single task or process if we divide multiple block, means we can execute a single task or process into multiple threads. this is called multi threading. 
=> example: playing a youtube video have many threads like comment thread, recommendation system thread, ad showing thread, video playing thread. all are runing parallelly or concurrently at the same time. this is called multi threading example
